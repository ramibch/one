Here are some Linux terminal commands that I find useful for me.

## Working with text files

- create file

```shell
touch file.txt
```
- create and open a file with _nano_

```shell
nano file.txt
```

- Read the content of a file (3 different approaches)

```shell
cat file.txt
more largefile.txt
less largefile.txt
```

- read the first 5 lines of a file

```shell
head -n 5 file.txt
```

- read the last 5 lines of a file

```shell
tail -n 5 file.txt
```
