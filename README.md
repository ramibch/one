## Commercial Etsy App

### Requirements

- Please be sure that the application's name follows our Trademark Policy. Application names cannot include “Etsy”, or derivatives of it.

- We also need to see proof that the notice of attribution has been added to your app or website. The text must read, "The term 'Etsy' is a trademark of Etsy, Inc. This application uses the Etsy API but is not endorsed or certified by Etsy, Inc." Please provide a link to the page on which it’s displayed, or a screenshot of the text within the 'Describe your Application' field.
